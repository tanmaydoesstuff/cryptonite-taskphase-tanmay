We navigate to the `challenge` directory by running the following command,
```
$ cd /challenge
```

Since running `run` is similar in path to `./challenge/run` we run that as the path. We do this because linux does not allow us to run a simple `run` command within the shell to avoid runnning a system executable by mistake as a safety measure.
```
$ ./challenge/run
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{88lzwGBSYSZoX_inOgt6w64rLwz.dFTN1QDL3kTO0czW}`
