We navigate to the root directory by running the following command
```
$ cd /
```

Then we run the relative path of the file to execute it. 
```
$ challenge/run
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{UQjJT3E-eibVpAB5zxsA-aY_3ES.dlDN1QDL3kTO0czW}`



Important Note:
In the earlier challenges, I was using the `exec` command on linux before writing the absolute path of the file to run it. But this would not work with this challenge. **To run a file in linux, you simply specify it's path. **

The `exec` commandÂ _replaces the current shell process with the specified command_. Hence when I was trying to run the following code, I was unable to obtain the flag as it was replacing the current shell process.

```
$ cd /
$ exec challenge/run
```
