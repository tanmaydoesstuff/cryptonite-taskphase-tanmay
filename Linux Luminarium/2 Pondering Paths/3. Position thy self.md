First we run the command
```
$ exec /challenge/run
```

This outputs a message that tells us we should navigate to the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`
We run the command to change our current working directory to the specified directory and then run the execution command again.
```
$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
$ exec /challenge/run
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{olYna1C86Q5miH8XmfNJ0jW47-l.dhjNyUDL3kTO0czW}`
