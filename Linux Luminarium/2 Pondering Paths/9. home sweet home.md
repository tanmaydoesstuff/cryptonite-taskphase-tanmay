We navigate to the `home` directory by running the following command,
```
$ cd ~
```

We run the `/challenge/run` program by giving it's absolute path and give the parameter as `~/w` which satisfies the conditions specified. This is required because we are writing the flag to any new file `w` with it's relative path being equal to three characters.
```
$ /challenge/run ~/w
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{cEo2md7qzahSd2BdYx94jaPcQop.dNzM4QDL3kTO0czW}`
