We navigate to the root directory by running the following command,
```
$ cd /
```

Since `./challenge/run` is similar in path to `challenge/run` we use that as the path. Then we run the relative path of the file to execute it,
```
$ ./challenge/run
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{kcmj4wCG4agT-4ENo8T2FY7de0D.dBTN1QDL3kTO0czW}`
