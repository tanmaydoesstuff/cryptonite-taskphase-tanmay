First, we head over to the manual page for `man`
```
$ man man
```

There I found that to search for a man page, you run the following command,
```
$ man -k challenge
jphdclecip (1)       - print the flag!
```

This returns `jphdclecip` as a manual page of the `/challenge/challenge` program, so we read it's manual,
```
$ man jphclecip
```

This returns the manual for jphclecip, which contains instructions and details that to get the flag, we need to use the `--jphdcl NUM` argument with NUM=869,
```
$ /challenge/challenge --jphdcl 869
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{IjphVdcZ8l6eBK9Xc5QLiSpGrCc.dZTM4QDL3kTO0czW}`
