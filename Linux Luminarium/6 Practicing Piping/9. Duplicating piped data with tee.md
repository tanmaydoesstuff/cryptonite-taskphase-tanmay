Run the command to intercept the output of `pwn` going to `college` with `tee` into the `intercept` file
```
$ /challenge/pwn | tee intercept | /challenge/college
```

Then we read the intercept file, which tells us the argument to pass to the `/challenge/pwn` program,
```
$ cat intercept
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "o7PH9qJA"
```

Then run the program with the arguments specified and pipe the output to `college`,
```
$ /challenge/pwn --secret o7PH9qJA | /challenge/college
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{o7PH9qJA_P3zkN4FseAeIATv2or.dFjM5QDL3kTO0czW}`
