In this challenge, we have to execute multiple commands to find the flag file. 
We have to use `cd` when the clue says the file is delayed, `-ls` when the message says the file will autodestruct if you `cd` into the directory.


```
$ cd /
$ ls -a
.           SPOILER  challenge  flag  lib32   media  opt   run   sys  var
..          bin      dev        home  lib64   mnt    proc  sbin  tmp
.dockerenv  boot     etc        lib   libx32  nix    root  srv   usr
$ cat SPOILER
Tubular find!
The next clue is in: /usr/share/help/ko


$ cd /usr/share/help/ko
$ ls
MEMO  gedit
$ cat MEMO
Yahaha, you found me!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/tools/include/nolibc

The next clue is **delayed** --- it will not become readable until you enter the directory with 'cd'.


$ cd /opt/linux/linux-5.4/tools/include/nolibc
$ ls -a
.  ..  TRACE  nolibc.h
$ cat TRACE
Great sleuthing!
The next clue is in: /usr/share/racket/pkgs/typed-racket-more/typed/web-server/configuration/compiled

The next clue is **delayed** --- it will not become readable until you enter the directory with 'cd'.


$ cd /usr/share/racket/pkgs/typed-racket-more/typed/web-server/configuration/compiled
$ ls -a
.  ..  HINT  responders_rkt.dep  responders_rkt.zo
$ cat HINT
Tubular find!
The next clue is in: /opt/aflplusplus/frida_mode/test/perf

The next clue is **delayed** --- it will not become readable until you enter the directory with 'cd'.


$ cd /opt/aflplusplus/frida_mode/test/perf
$ ls -a
.  ..  DISPATCH  GNUmakefile  Makefile  perf.c
$ cat DISPATCH
Yahaha, you found me!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/tools/perf/python


$ cd /opt/linux/linux-5.4/tools/perf/python
$ ls -a
.  ..  NOTE  tracepoint.py  twatch.py
$ cat NOTE
Congratulations, you found the clue!
The next clue is in: /usr/share/racket/collects/xml

The next clue is **hidden** --- its filename starts with a '.' character. You'll need to look for it using special options to 'ls'.


$ cd /usr/share/racket/collects/xml
$ ls -a
.   .GIST     main.rkt  plist.rkt  xexpr.rkt
..  compiled  path.rkt  private    xml.rkt
$ cat .GIST
Yahaha, you found me!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/gpu/drm/mga

The next clue is **delayed** --- it will not become readable until you enter the directory with 'cd'.


$ cd /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/gpu/drm/mga
$ ls -a
.   ALERT     mga_dma.c  mga_drv.h    mga_irq.c    mga_warp.c
..  Makefile  mga_drv.c  mga_ioc32.c  mga_state.c
$ cat ALERT
Lucky listing!
The next clue is in: /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/dax/pmem

Watch out! The next clue is **trapped**. You'll need to read it out without 'cd'ing into the directory; otherwise, the clue will self destruct!


$ ls /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/dax/pmem
MESSAGE-TRAPPED  Makefile  compat.c  core.c  pmem.c

$ cat /opt/linux/linux-5.4/drivers/dax/pmem/MESSAGE-TRAPPED
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{8Hoe-QFqfeqVA5uQuBLv3cqWWrW.dljM4QDL3kTO0czW}`
