Run the command to write the `stderr` output of `hack` into `the` and the `stdout` output of `hack` into `planet`, both of which are programs, hence the extra brackets and operators,
```
$ /challenge/hack > >(/challenge/planet) 2> >(/challenge/the)
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{4g3mZrwFYUCajBNfF0OMlbYUvSk.dFDNwYDL3kTO0czW}`
