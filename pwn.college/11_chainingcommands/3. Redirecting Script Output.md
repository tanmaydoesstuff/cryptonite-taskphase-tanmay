First create a shell script file called `x.sh` with the following text in vim,
```
/challenge/pwn;/challenge/college
```

Then run the following command to pipe the output of the shell script to another 
```
$ bash x.sh | /challenge/solve
```

We obtain the flag `pwn.college{sSrcG9Z4E6j8SBQy2ENZIPkh9wY.dhTM5QDL3kTO0czW}`
