Run the command to set the value of variable `PWN` to `COLLEGE` while exporting it to pass it on to other child programs and set the value of variable `COLLEGE` to `PWN` without exporting,
```
$ export PWN=COLLEGE
$ COLLEGE=PWN
$ /challenge/run
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{4t5Sk7fOdrrnNnlb-aiCid7yYTL.dJjN1QDL3kTO0czW}`
