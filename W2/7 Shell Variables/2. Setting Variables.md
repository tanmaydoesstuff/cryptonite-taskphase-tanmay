Run the command to set the value of variable `PWN` to `COLLEGE`,
```
$ PWN=COLLEGE
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{8JGKqLQtzhd56G6unA9GthqKa5s.dlTN1QDL3kTO0czW}`


Interesting things to note here:
- that there should be no spaces, since then the prpgram would try to run `VAR` independently
- no use of `$` as that is only applicable when **accessing** variables
