You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod a=rwx /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{s24XZrFiCybF2ijlAMdqPPtB9OF.dNTM5QDL3kTO0czW}
```

We obtain the flag `pwn.college{s24XZrFiCybF2ijlAMdqPPtB9OF.dNTM5QDL3kTO0czW}`
