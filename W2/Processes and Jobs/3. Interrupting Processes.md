Run the program and then `Ctrl+C` to temporarily exit the program,
```
$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wLU16oBX5QgV7pRQK2FnaGOhL_T.dNDN4QDL3kTO0czW}

```

We get the flag `pwn.college{wLU16oBX5QgV7pRQK2FnaGOhL_T.dNDN4QDL3kTO0czW}`
