Run the commands to first run the program, then suspend it, then background a copy of it, and then run a fresh program,
```
$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running *and 
not suspended* in this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID STAT CMD
root          83 S+   bash /challenge/run
root          85 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me, resume the suspended process in the 
background, and then launch a new version of me! You can background me with 
Ctrl-Z (and resume me in the background with 'bg') or, if you're not ready to 
do that for whatever reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run


$ bg /challenge/run
[1]+ /challenge/run &



Yay, I'm now running the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt. Don't panic; just hit Enter a few times 
to scroll this text out.

root          94 S+   bash /challenge/run
root          96 R+   ps -o user=UID,pid,stat,cmd

Yay, I found another version of me running in the background! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{0jzcs0YCEjjFusIgPG98stcxtBe.ddDN4QDL3kTO0czW}
```

We get the flag `pwn.college{0jzcs0YCEjjFusIgPG98stcxtBe.ddDN4QDL3kTO0czW}`
