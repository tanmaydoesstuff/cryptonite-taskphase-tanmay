To be able to run the `cat` command while ensuring that we run a different version of the `rm` command, I had a few initial ~~attempts~~ struggles and figured them out:
1. Trying to create a new `rm` file in the `/home/hacker/` directory, where the new rm file read `cat`. This did not work as the file had to say `cat /flag`, otherwise the program would be stuck in an infinite loop/not know what to print.

2. Trying to overwrite the PATH variable using `PATH=/home/hacker/` didn't work, because then the `cat` command would be missing and it would be again stuck in an infinite loop.

3. It was essential that we append to the PATH variable at the beginning, so that the system executes from the instructions in the first `rm` file (our edited `rm` file), so that the original `rm` which will delete the flag is ignored.
   
4. It is also important to make the new `rm` file executable using `chmod +x rm`.
   

The final commands were as follows, with the `rm` file reading as `cat /flag` in the `/home/hacker` directory itself, 
```
$ vim rm
$ cat rm
cat /flag

$ export PATH=/home/hacker/:$PATH
$ chmod +x rm
$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
Found 'rm' command at /home/hacker//rm. Executing!
```


We obtain the flag `pwn.college{AP4MSMM767uTVxYlw-lgD4gS6Wr.ddzNyUDL3kTO0czW}`
